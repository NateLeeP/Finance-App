<h3 class='text-center font-less-bold'>How is expected return calculated?</h3>
<p class='text-center'>Our calculations for expected portfolio return are based of the <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capm.asp'>Capital Asset Pricing Model</a>. The CAPM calculates  expected return based on a combination of the the underlying portfolio's market return and beta. In this scenario, the expected market return is equivalent to the peak-to-trough decline (56%) of the S&P500 during the 2007-2009 Financial Crisis. The portfolio beta is calculated by retrieivng up-to-date beta information for individual securities. Beta is a measure of volatility of a security or portfolio. Beta for individual securities is measured using the last years worth of prices. Portfolio beta is the market capitalization weighted sum of the individual security betas. Your portfolio beta is then used to calculate an expected portfolio return given the expected market return. The higher the beta, the more volatile the portfolio will be compared to the overall market. For more information on the beta, click <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp'>here</a>.</p>

<p class='text-center'>The portfolio beta is also used when estimate your recovery time. A higher portfolio beta hurts more when the market declines, but it will also cause a faster recovery.</p>
